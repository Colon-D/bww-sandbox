Proof of concept mod for Balan Wonderworld.
- Enables infinite costume uses:
  - costume uses never decreases
  - costume uses only increases from 0 to 1
- Enables a buggy Force Jump key on "Space Bar", "Caps Lock" and "Right Click":
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Please manually rebind "Jump/Costume Ability" from "Space Bar":
    - Settings -> Controls -> Keyboard Configuration
  - Can be configured to different keys in `Sandbox\Scripts\main.lua`
  - If you want Gamepad binds, use Steam Input's Controller Configurator to bind a Gamepad button to a bound Keyboard key, like "Space Bar".
    Note this will affect other uses of that button, like the UI.
  - üêû Bugs:
    - Only full jumps
    - Can jump when you shouldn't be able too:
      - In Cutscenes
      - Using certain abilities (small list of examples):
        - Dusk Butterfly: Can jump forever by spamming force jump.
        - Pounding Pig: Can jump forever by force jumping as soon as ground pounding.
        - Jumping Jack: Can double jump by jumping whilst fluttering.
